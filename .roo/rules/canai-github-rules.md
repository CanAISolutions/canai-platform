# CanAI GitHub Guidelines

## Purpose

Foster collaboration, quality, and alignment with the 9-stage user journey (F1-F9) of the CanAI
Emotional Sovereignty Platform, guided by the PRD to ensure efficient, secure, and adaptable
repository management.

## Scope

Provide high-level guidance for managing GitHub repositories, emphasizing PRD alignment, team
collaboration, and flexibility to adapt to project needs.

## Guiding Principles

### PRD Alignment

- Ensure repository practices support PRD objectives (e.g., API consistency, testing, security).
- Adapt workflows to reflect PRD updates and project evolution.

### Collaboration

- Promote clear communication and inclusive decision-making.
- Encourage contributions from all relevant team members.

### Quality

- Maintain high standards for code, testing, and documentation.
- Use automation to enforce consistency and prevent regressions.

### Security

- Protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with PRD privacy standards.
- Implement proactive security measures for code and dependencies.

## Repository Management

### Structure

- Organize repositories logically by function (e.g., backend, frontend, databases, documentation).
- Allow flexibility to adjust structure based on project needs and PRD guidance.

### Branching

- Use descriptive branch names tied to journey stages or tasks (e.g., `feature/f1-discovery`,
  `fix/f4-checkout`).
- Include intent (e.g., feature, fix, chore) for clarity.
- Adapt naming conventions to team preferences while ensuring traceability.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- Include clear titles, descriptions, and links to issues or PRD sections.
- Outline changes, testing approach, and potential impacts (e.g., APIs, performance).
- Require at least one review, prioritizing relevant expertise.
- Use CI/CD checks for automated validation (e.g., tests, linting).

### Code Reviews

- Provide timely, constructive feedback, targeting completion within 24 hours.
- Focus on PRD alignment, performance, security, accessibility, and test coverage.
- Allow flexibility in review rigor based on change complexity.

### AI-Generated Code

- Review AI-generated code for PRD compliance, error handling, and integration accuracy.
- Require human validation, with senior oversight for critical components (e.g., security, APIs).

### Issues

- Use clear, standardized issue templates with tags for priority, type, and journey stage.
- Link issues to milestones or tasks for tracking.
- Encourage detailed descriptions to aid resolution.

## Validation & Automation

### CI/CD Pipelines

- Implement automated checks for code quality, tests, and security.
- Adapt pipelines to project requirements, balancing thoroughness and speed.

### Monitoring

- Track repository health metrics (e.g., PR velocity, issue resolution).
- Monitor performance and security to align with PRD goals.

### Compliance

- Enable secret scanning and dependency checks to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Adhere to PRD privacy standards (e.g., GDPR/CCPA) for data handling.

## Workflow Integration

### Development Flow

- Align development with the 9-stage journey, prioritizing PRD requirements.
- Test iteratively to ensure API, frontend, and integration reliability.
- Optimize for performance and responsiveness per PRD targets.

### Releases

- Use semantic versioning with detailed changelogs.
- Employ feature flags for controlled rollouts.
- Maintain rollback plans for quick recovery.

## Development Practices

### Communication

- Use GitHub Discussions for planning and PRD clarifications.
- Maintain a professional, clear tone in all interactions.

### Code Quality

- Write reliable, well-tested code with robust error handling.
- Incorporate security practices (e.g., input validation) early.
- Ensure comprehensive testing aligned with PRD strategies.

### Documentation

- Provide clear, up-to-date documentation for APIs, decisions, and workflows.
- Reflect PRD specifications and project updates accurately.

## Quality Assurance

### Anti-Patterns

- Avoid unapproved deviations from PRD scope.
- Prevent regressions with automated testing.
- Ensure features are complete before merging.

### Standards

- Include thorough documentation for functions and APIs.
- Prioritize unit, integration, and accessibility tests.
- Monitor performance to meet PRD benchmarks.

## Ownership

- **Backend Team**: Manages API and service code.
- **Frontend Team**: Oversees UI components and journey alignment.
- **QA Team**: Validates code quality and PRD compliance.
- **DevOps Team**: Maintains CI/CD and monitoring.

## References

- **PRD Sections**: API Catalog, Testing, Security, Deployment, Risk Mitigation.
- **Standards**: Emphasize PRD precedence, collaboration, and security.
