# CanAI GitHub Repository Management Rules

## Purpose
Standardize GitHub repository management for the **CanAI Emotional Sovereignty Platform**, ensuring consistent collaboration, code quality, and alignment with the 9-stage user journey (F1-F9) across backend APIs (`backend/routes/`), frontend components (`frontend/src/`), and integrations.

## Standards

### Repository Structure
- **Organize by Function**: Use standardized structure:
  - `backend/` - Express.js APIs, middleware, services, webhooks
  - `frontend/` - React/Next.js application with 9-stage journey components
  - `databases/` - Supabase schemas, migrations, and seed data
  - `docs/` - Project documentation and guides
  - `packages/` - Shared configurations and TypeScript configs
  - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD automation and quality gates

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Stage-Based Naming**: Use `{type}/f{stage}-{feature}` format aligned with 9-stage journey:
  - `feature/f1-discovery-hook` - F1: Discovery Hook implementation
  - `feature/f2-discovery-funnel` - F2: 2-Step Discovery Funnel
  - `feature/f3-spark-layer` - F3: Spark Layer generation
  - `feature/f4-purchase-flow` - F4: Purchase Flow and Stripe integration
  - `feature/f5-detailed-input` - F5: Detailed Input Collection
  - `feature/f6-intent-mirror` - F6: Intent Mirror validation
  - `feature/f7-deliverable-gen` - F7: Deliverable Generation
  - `feature/f8-spark-split` - F8: SparkSplit comparison
  - `feature/f9-feedback-capture` - F9: Feedback Capture
  - `fix/f{stage}-{issue}` - Bug fixes for specific stages
  - `hotfix/critical-{description}` - Critical production fixes
  - `chore/infrastructure-{description}` - Infrastructure and tooling updates

### Pull Request Requirements
- **Mandatory Elements**:
  - **Title**: Clear, descriptive with stage reference (e.g., "F3: Implement spark regeneration with GPT-4o fallback")
  - **Description**: Include problem, solution, testing approach, and performance impact
  - **Linked Issue**: Reference GitHub issue with priority and type tags
  - **TaskMaster ID**: Reference specific TaskMaster task (e.g., `T8.1.1-backend-setup`)
  - **API Changes**: Document new/modified endpoints from Section 8.7 API catalog
  - **Performance Impact**: Note latency targets (<2s generation, <100ms errors)
  - **Security Review**: Confirm RLS policies, input validation, and GDPR compliance
- **Review Requirements**: Minimum one approval from codeowner before merge
- **Pre-merge Validation**: All CI/CD checks must pass (tests, linting, security scans)

### Code Review Standards
- **Response Time**: Complete reviews within 24 hours; escalate via PagerDuty for delays
- **Review Criteria**:
  - **PRD Alignment**: Verify compliance with 9-stage journey requirements
  - **Performance**: Ensure <2s response times for critical endpoints
  - **Security**: Validate Supabase RLS, input sanitization, authentication
  - **Testing**: Require >80% coverage with Jest/Supatest
  - **Accessibility**: Confirm WCAG 2.2 AA compliance (â‰¥4.5:1 contrast, ARIA labels)
  - **API Consistency**: Follow Section 8.7 API catalog patterns
  - **Error Handling**: Implement <100ms empathetic error responses

### AI Code Review
- **AI Review Checklist**: Required for all PR reviews involving AI-generated code:
  - **Format Compliance**: Verify code matches project TypeScript standards and naming conventions
  - **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure proper error handling for GPT-4o timeouts, Hume AI rate limits, Stripe failures
  - **Hallucination Prevention**: Validate API endpoints exist, database schemas are correct, file paths are accurate
  - **PRD Alignment**: Confirm AI-generated code adheres to 9-stage journey requirements and performance targets
  - **Integration Validity**: Verify Supabase, Make.com, and external API integrations are properly implemented
  - **Security Patterns**: Ensure RLS policies, input validation, and authentication are correctly applied

### Human Oversight Requirements
- **Mandatory Human Review**: All AI-generated code must have human oversight before merge
- **Senior Developer Approval**: AI-generated backend APIs, database schemas, and security implementations require senior developer review
- **Documentation Verification**: Human reviewers must validate that AI-generated documentation is accurate and complete
- **Performance Validation**: Human oversight required for performance-critical code (API endpoints, database queries)
- **Security Audit**: Manual security review mandatory for AI-generated authentication, authorization, and data handling code

### Issue Tracking and Management
- **GitHub Issues**: Use comprehensive tagging system:
  - **Priority**: `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
  - **Type**: `type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:enhancement`, `type:security`
  - **Stage**: `stage:f1` through `stage:f9` for journey-specific issues
  - **Component**: `component:backend`, `component:frontend`, `component:database`
  - **Integration**: `integration:supabase`, `integration:stripe`, `integration:gpt4o`, `integration:hume-ai`
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized templates for bugs, features, and security issues
- **Epic Tracking**: Link related issues to epic milestones for major features

### Collaboration and Communication
- **GitHub Discussions**: Use for architectural decisions, technical planning, and PRD clarification
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date technical documentation in `docs/` folder
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant technical decisions
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Tag appropriate reviewers based on component ownership

## Validation and Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline Enforcement
- **Automated Validation**: `.github/workflows/pr.yml` enforces:
  - Branch naming compliance with stage-based format
  - PR template completion and required fields
  - TaskMaster ID validation and task alignment
  - Performance benchmark validation
- **Quality Gates**: 
  - ESLint validation (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)
  - Jest unit tests with >80% coverage requirement
  - Supatest integration tests for API endpoints
  - Security scans with OWASP ZAP and Semgrep
  - Accessibility testing with axe-core

### Repository Health Monitoring
- **TaskMaster Alignment**: Automated checks ensure GitHub issues align with TaskMaster tasks
- **Analytics Integration**: PostHog tracking for development metrics:
  - `pr_created` - Pull request creation with stage and component
  - `pr_merged` - Successful merge with review duration
  - `issue_resolved` - Issue closure with resolution time
