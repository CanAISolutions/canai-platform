# CanAI TaskMaster Guidelines

## Purpose
Facilitate clear, traceable, and efficient TaskMaster task definitions for the CanAI Emotional Sovereignty Platform, ensuring alignment with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the 9-stage user journey while promoting modular development.

## Guidelines

### Task Structure
- Use descriptive, unique task IDs to ensure clarity and traceability.
- Include essential fields: description, inputs, outputs, dependencies, and AI instructions.
- Clearly state the task’s objective in the description.
- Verify that outputs align with the task’s goal.

### Dependency Management
- Specify prerequisite tasks clearly to guide execution order.
- Prevent circular dependencies through validation checks.
- Confirm dependencies are resolved before task execution.

### Project Alignment
- Map tasks to backend, frontend, database, or other project components.
- Align tasks with user journey stages, such as discovery or deliverables.
- Design tasks to reflect modular, feature-focused functionality.

### Performance and Quality
- Target efficient API and AI processing times, guided by PRD goals.
- Ensure high test coverage for task deliverables.
- Design user-facing components to meet accessibility standards.
- Incorporate security measures like access controls and input validation.

### AI Integration
- Structure AI tasks to include prompt management and output validation.
- Implement fallbacks for AI service limitations or failures.
- Validate AI outputs for quality metrics, such as resonance or trust scores.

### Documentation
- Maintain clear records of tasks and their dependencies.
- Update API documentation for new or modified endpoints.
- Keep system architecture and deployment guides current.
- Document task outcomes to support traceability.

### Validation
- Check dependencies and inputs before task execution.
- Verify outputs through testing and performance checks post-execution.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to enforce task standards and quality.

### Monitoring
- Track task completion and performance metrics for insights.
- Log errors with context to aid debugging and recovery.
- Monitor task impact on user journey and system performance.

### AI Development
- Provide clear AI instructions for code generation or assistance.
- Reference reusable patterns to ensure consistency.
- Specify testing requirements for AI-generated outputs.
- Ensure AI outputs integrate seamlessly with existing systems.

### Error Handling
- Apply retry logic for external service calls to enhance reliability.
- Use fallback strategies to maintain functionality during failures.
- Log errors with sufficient detail for troubleshooting.

### Security and Compliance
- Secure task-related endpoints with authentication.
- Enforce user-scoped data access controls.
- Adhere to data protection regulations, per PRD.

## Task Categories
- Foundation: Infrastructure setup and configuration.
- API: Endpoints supporting user journey stages.
- Integration: Connections with third-party services.
- Testing: Quality assurance and validation tasks.
- Security: Data protection and compliance measures.
- Deployment: Release and operational tasks.

## PRD Alignment
- Support PRD requirements for functionality, performance, and security.
- Align with user journey, architecture, and integration specifications.
- Prioritize PRD guidance, adapting these guidelines to avoid conflicts.

## Development Principles
- **Traceability**: Ensure clear mappings from tasks to deliverables.
- **Modularity**: Design focused, reusable tasks.
- **Quality**: Deliver testable, high-performance outputs.
- **Flexibility**: Adapt tasks to evolving PRD needs.
