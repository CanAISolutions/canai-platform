## Current Development Context

### Active Priorities

1. **Discovery Hook Implementation (F1)**: Complete trust indicators system and pricing modal
   integration
2. **API Foundation**: Establish core backend routes per PRD Section 8.7 specifications
3. **Database Schema**: Implement Supabase tables with RLS for user journey tracking
4. **Testing Framework**: Set up Jest testing infrastructure with >80% coverage target

### Immediate Tasks

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

1. **Hume AI Rate Limits**: 1000 req/day limitation requires careful quota management

2. **Complex User Journey**: 9-stage flow may introduce drop-off points
   - _Mitigation_: Progressive enhancement with localStorage fallbacks
3. **Performance Targets**: <2s deliverable generation challenging with multiple AI calls
   - _Mitigation_: Aggressive caching and asynchronous processing

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple external services increase failure points
2. **Content Quality**: Emotional resonance validation requires sophisticated algorithms
3. **User Experience**: Balance between functionality and simplicity
