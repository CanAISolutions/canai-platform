# TaskMaster Preparation - CanAI Platform

## Project Scope and Boundaries

### IN SCOPE for TaskMaster

- Backend API implementation (routes, services, middleware)
- Database migrations and schema setup
- AI service integrations (GPT-4o, Hume AI)
- External service integrations (Stripe, Make.com, PostHog)
- Authentication and security implementation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Performance optimization

### OUT OF SCOPE for TaskMaster

- Frontend component modifications (already implemented)
- UI/UX design changes
- Project structure changes
- Build system modifications
- CI/CD pipeline changes
- Documentation updates (unless specifically required)

## Key Dependencies

### Infrastructure Dependencies

- Supabase: Database and authentication platform
- Render: Deployment and hosting platform
- Node.js: Runtime environment (>=18.0.0)

### External Service Dependencies

- OpenAI API: GPT-4o integration
- Hume AI API: Emotional resonance validation
- Stripe API: Payment processing
- Make.com API: Workflow automation
- PostHog API: Analytics tracking
- Memberstack API: User management

### Development Dependencies

- TypeScript: Strict mode enforcement
- ESLint: Code quality and standards
- Vitest: Testing framework
- Prettier: Code formatting

## Critical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- API endpoints must respond in <200ms (standard operations)
- AI generation must complete in <2s
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing
- Caching must be implemented for frequently accessed data

### Security Requirements

- All database access must use Row Level Security (RLS)
- API endpoints must include proper authentication
- Input validation must be comprehensive
- Error handling must not expose sensitive information

### Quality Requirements

- Test coverage must exceed 80%
- TypeScript must be in strict mode
- All code must pass ESLint validation
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance

## Development Approach

### Task Priority Order

1. Infrastructure setup (Render, Supabase)
2. Core backend APIs (9-stage journey)
3. AI service integrations
4. External service integrations
5. Testing and validation
6. Performance optimization

### Risk Mitigation

- Environment variable validation before deployment
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation for external service failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for AI services
- Backup and rollback procedures

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success

- All backend APIs implemented and tested
- Database schema complete with RLS policies
- AI services integrated with proper fallbacks
- External services configured and validated
- Test suite achieving >80% coverage

### Quality Success

- Zero TypeScript errors in strict mode
- All ESLint rules passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security audit passing
- Accessibility compliance verified

### Integration Success

- Frontend-backend integration functioning
- External services responding correctly
- Analytics tracking operational
- Monitoring and alerting active
- Deployment pipeline working
