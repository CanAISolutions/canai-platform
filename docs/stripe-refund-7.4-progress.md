**Instructions:**
- Update the Status column as each requirement progresses (To Do → In Progress → Done).
- Add concrete evidence for each completed item (file/line refs, test output, screenshots/logs, etc.).
- Reference relevant PRD.md and stripe-payment-strategy.md sections for traceability.
- Use this as the single source of truth for Task 7.4 completion.
