# Emotional Analysis API

## Overview
This API provides endpoints for analyzing the emotional resonance of text using Hume AI and a GPT-4o fallback. It supports the CanAI Emotional Sovereignty Platform's F6 (Intent Mirror), F7 (Deliverable Generation), and F8 (SparkSplit) stages, and aligns with PRD Sections 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 7.1, 7.2, 12, and 14.1.

## POST /v1/analyze-emotion
**Description:** Analyze the emotional resonance of input text using Hume AI or GPT-4o fallback.

- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "text": "This is a warm and inviting business plan",
    "comparisonId": "uuid"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "arousal": 0.7,
    "valence": 0.8,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "source": "hume",
    "error": null
  }
  ```
- **Error Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error message"
  }
  ```
- **Authentication:** Memberstack JWT required (user context)
- **Validation:**
  - `text`: string, required, 1-1000 chars
  - `comparisonId`: UUID, required
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 req/min per IP
- **Fallback:** If Hume AI is unavailable or circuit breaker is open, GPT-4o is used
- **PRD Alignment:** F6, F7, F8, 7.2, 14.1

## GET /v1/analyze-emotion/status
**Description:** Check the status of the emotional analysis service (admin only).

- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "operational",
    "circuitBreakerState": "CLOSED",
    "error": null
  }
  ```
- **Authentication:** Memberstack JWT (admin role required)
- **PRD Alignment:** 7.2, 14.1

## Error Codes
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (validation error)
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions (admin required)
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected error or downstream service failure

## Example Usage
### Request
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.canai.com/v1/analyze-emotion \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This is a warm and inviting business plan", "comparisonId": "uuid"}'
```
### Response
```json
{
  "arousal": 0.7,
  "valence": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "source": "hume",
  "error": null
}
```

## Notes
- All requests and responses are JSON.
- Input is validated using Joi; errors return a 400 with details.
- Circuit breaker state is reported in the status endpoint.
- All errors are logged to Sentry and PostHog for observability.
- Emotional scores are stored in the `comparisons` table with `emotional_score` and `score_source` fields.
- Data is purged after 24 months for GDPR/CCPA compliance.

## PRD Alignment
- **F6: Intent Mirror** – Validates emotional resonance for user intent summaries
- **F7: Deliverable Generation** – Ensures deliverables meet emotional thresholds
- **F8: SparkSplit** – Supports comparison of CanAI outputs with emotional resonance scores
- **7.2: Security** – Rate limiting, input validation, and error handling
- **14.1: Compliance** – GDPR/CCPA data retention and privacy

## GDPR/CCPA Data Retention & Purge Policy

To comply with GDPR and CCPA requirements, all user data in the `public.comparisons` table is automatically deleted after 24 months. This is enforced by a scheduled SQL job (`databases/cron/purge.sql`) using Supabase's `pg_cron` extension. The purge job runs daily and removes any records older than 24 months based on the `created_at` timestamp.

- **Retention Period:** 24 months
- **Data Purged:** All records in `public.comparisons` older than 24 months
- **Scheduling:** Automated via `pg_cron` (see `databases/cron/purge.sql`)
- **Compliance:** Ensures platform meets GDPR/CCPA data minimization and right-to-erasure requirements.

For more details or to adjust the retention policy, see the SQL script and Supabase/pg_cron documentation.
