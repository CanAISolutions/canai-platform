# Subscription Management Requirements (Task 7.5)

**Last updated:** {{date}}

## Overview
This document tracks requirements and deliverables for implementing comprehensive subscription management, as defined in TaskMaster task 7.5. It is aligned with the PRD, tasks.json, and the Stripe Payment Strategy.

---

## 1. Objective
Implement robust subscription lifecycle management, including creation, updates, cancellations, pauses, and status tracking, with full integration into logging, analytics, and compliance systems.

---

## 2. Key Deliverables
- Subscription creation service (Stripe + backend integration)
- Plan change (upgrade/downgrade) and proration logic
- Subscription cancellation and pause functionality
- Webhook event handling for:
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
- Product switching (one-time to subscription and vice versa)
- Subscription status tracking in Supabase
- Integration with logging/monitoring (Sentry, PostHog)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Security and access controls (Memberstack auth)
- Documentation and test coverage

---

## 3. Requirements
### 3.1. Subscription Lifecycle
- Support creation, update, cancellation, and pause of subscriptions via backend API.
- Use Stripe API for all subscription operations; never store card data.
- Attach user and product metadata to all Stripe sessions.
- Enforce idempotency for all operations.

### 3.2. Plan Changes & Proration
- Allow users to upgrade/downgrade plans mid-cycle.
- Implement proration logic per Stripe best practices.
- Log all plan changes and proration events in Supabase.

### 3.3. Webhook Event Handling
- Securely handle Stripe webhook events for subscription lifecycle.
- Verify webhook signatures using environment secrets.
- Ensure idempotent processing of all events.
- On `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted`, update Supabase status and log event.

### 3.4. Product Switching
- Allow switching between product tracks (e.g., Business Plan Builder â†’ Website Audit).
- For one-time to subscription, create new session; for subscription to one-time, cancel subscription and create new session.
- Handle proration and refunds as needed.

### 3.5. Status Tracking & Analytics
- Store subscription status, plan, and user linkage in Supabase.
- Enforce RLS so users only access their own data.
- Log all events to `payment_logs` for analytics.
- Integrate with PostHog for trend analysis.

### 3.6. Error Handling & Security
- Centralized error handling with Sentry integration.
- Retry logic for transient errors (max 3 attempts, exponential backoff).
- Restrict sensitive endpoints to authenticated users/admins (Memberstack).
- PCI compliance: never store card data.

### 3.7. Testing & Documentation
- Unit and integration tests for all flows (mock Stripe/Supabase as needed).
- Webhook event simulation in tests.
- Manual QA in Stripe test mode.
- Update this document and related docs as implementation progresses.

---

## 4. Implementation Notes
- Follow modular service architecture (see backend/services/stripe.js).
- Use environment variables for all secrets/config.
- Reference `stripe-payment-strategy.md` for detailed flow and error handling.
- Ensure all changes are PRD-aligned and documented in this file.
