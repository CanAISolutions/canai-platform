# Intent Mirror: Feature Overview for PRD

## What It Is

The **Intent Mirror** is a conceptual AI-powered **intent validation layer** within CanAI’s Discovery Funnel. It serves as a **confirmation checkpoint** that ensures the AI accurately understands a user’s goals, tone, and emotional drivers before generating outputs. Think of it as a trusted partner that listens carefully, repeats back what it hears, and confirms alignment before acting.

## Why It Matters

**Problem**: User prompts are often ambiguous, leading to misaligned AI outputs that waste time, resources, and trust. For example, a user might request “launch a campaign” but mean different things (e.g., email list vs. social media) or want a specific tone (e.g., supportive vs. bold).

**Solution**: Intent Mirror eliminates guesswork by interpreting and validating user intent, ensuring outputs precisely match their vision.

**Value Proposition**: Intent Mirror transforms user-AI interactions into confident, trust-building experiences, delivering relevant outputs while saving resources and boosting user satisfaction.

## How It Works (Conceptual 5-Step Process)

1. **Intent Inference**
   - Analyzes raw user input (e.g., text, form responses) to identify key elements: business type, primary goal, desired tone, and motivations.
   - Uses AI to assign confidence scores to each interpretation (e.g., 90% sure the tone is “supportive”).

2. **Emotional Clarification**
   - If confidence is low (<80%) or emotional context is unclear, prompts the user with a question like, “What would success feel like for this goal?”
   - Captures deeper emotional drivers (e.g., “build confidence” vs. “drive sales”) to enrich intent understanding.

3. **User Confirmation**
   - Presents a concise summary: _“You’re a consultant launching an email campaign with a supportive tone. Is this correct?”_
   - Uses confidence-based language to guide the user:
     - ≥90%: “Looks great!”
     - 80–89%: “Does this seem right?”
     - <80%: “Let’s fine-tune this.”

4. **User Feedback**
   - Allows one-click confirmation or simple edits (e.g., change tone to “bold”).
   - Collects feedback on user changes to improve future predictions.

5. **Validated Intent Output**
   - Produces a structured intent profile (e.g., goal, tone, emotional drivers) with confidence scores and emotional context.
   - Passes this profile to the AI system for accurate content generation (e.g., strategies, campaigns).

## Emotional Intelligence Core

Intent Mirror is built on **emotional sovereignty**, ensuring users:

- **Feel Seen**: Their goals and emotions are accurately reflected.
- **Feel Trusted**: Transparent validation builds confidence in the AI.
- **Feel Empowered**: Their intentions drive outcomes, not assumptions.

This approach turns potential frustration into **trust momentum**, fostering deeper engagement and loyalty.

## User Example

**Scenario**: Sarah, a small business owner, enters “launch a campaign” in the Discovery Funnel. Intent Mirror infers she wants to “launch an email campaign” with a “supportive tone” (92% confidence). It asks, _“You’re launching an email campaign with a supportive tone. Correct?”_ Sarah confirms, and the AI generates a tailored email strategy, saving her time and ensuring alignment with her vision.

## Success Metrics

When implemented, Intent Mirror should achieve:

- **Efficiency**: ≥25% reduction in resource usage (e.g., processing tokens) by optimizing prompts.
- **Accuracy**: ≥30% reduction in misaligned outputs.
- **Engagement**: ≥85% user confirmation rate.
- **Trust**: ≥4.4/5 trust score per session (via user surveys).
- **Precision**: ≤5% rate of user edits to inferred intent.

## Implementation Requirements

To build Intent Mirror from scratch, the following components are needed:

1. **AI Inference Engine**
   - A lightweight AI model to analyze user input and extract structured data (e.g., business type, tone).
   - Must support confidence scoring and emotional driver detection.
   - Priority: High (core to step 1).

2. **Emotional Clarification Module**
   - Logic to trigger clarifying questions when confidence is low or emotional context is missing.
   - Predefined question templates (e.g., “What would success feel like?”).
   - Priority: High (core to step 2).

3. **Confirmation Interface**
   - A user-friendly UI to display intent summaries and collect feedback (e.g., confirm, edit).
   - Responsive design for web and mobile.
   - Confidence-based microcopy (e.g., “Looks great!” vs. “Let’s fine-tune”).
   - Priority: High (core to steps 3–4).

4. **Feedback Learning System**
   - A database to store user edits and feedback.
   - Algorithms to analyze edits and improve default predictions over time.
   - Priority: Medium (enhances step 4, critical for long-term accuracy).

5. **Output Formatter**
   - A system to generate structured intent profiles (e.g., JSON with goal, tone, confidence).
   - Integration with downstream AI systems for content generation.
   - Priority: High (core to step 5).

6. **Privacy Protections**
   - Data anonymization to comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
   - Secure storage of user inputs and feedback.
   - Priority: High (non-negotiable for launch).

7. **Metrics Tracking**
   - Tools to measure token usage, confirmation rates, trust scores, and edit rates.
   - Dashboards for real-time performance monitoring.
   - Priority: Medium (critical for post-launch optimization).

## Development Sequence

To ensure proper implementation, follow this phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core Inference & Output (3–4 months)**
   - Build AI inference engine and output formatter.
   - Develop basic emotional clarification logic (e.g., question triggers).
   - Outcome: System can interpret input and produce structured intent.

2. **Phase 2: User Interface & Feedback (2–3 months)**
   - Design and implement confirmation interface.
   - Add feedback collection and basic storage.
   - Outcome: Users can validate intent via UI.

3. **Phase 3: Emotional Intelligence & Learning (2–3 months)**
   - Enhance emotional clarification with advanced question templates.
   - Build feedback learning system to improve predictions.
   - Outcome: System adapts to user behavior and prioritizes emotional sovereignty.

4. **Phase 4: Privacy & Metrics (1–2 months)**
   - Implement privacy protections and compliance checks.
   - Add metrics tracking and dashboards.
   - Outcome: System is production-ready with monitoring capabilities.

5. **Phase 5: Beta Testing & Iteration (2 months)**
   - Conduct A/B testing with/without Intent Mirror to validate metrics.
   - Iterate based on user feedback and performance data.
   - Outcome: Fully validated feature ready for launch.

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 10–14 months.

## Stakeholder Benefits

- **Users**: Save time, feel understood, and receive relevant outputs.
- **Product Team**: Drive higher satisfaction and retention with a differentiated feature.
- **Engineers**: Follow a clear, phased roadmap with measurable milestones.
- **Executives**: Reduce costs (e.g., tokens) and strengthen CanAI’s competitive edge.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Over-reliance on user feedback slows down interactions.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize UI for one-click confirmations and minimize edit prompts.
- **Risk**: AI misinterprets complex inputs, reducing confidence scores.
  - **Mitigation**: Train inference model on diverse datasets and refine clarification questions.
- **Risk**: Privacy compliance delays launch.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize privacy protections in Phase 4 and consult legal experts early.

## In Simple Terms

Intent Mirror is like a skilled waiter who repeats your order to ensure it’s perfect before sending it to the kitchen. It’s an AI that says, _“Here’s what I understand about your goals and how you want this to feel—correct?”_ before creating your strategy or content. It’s the difference between hoping the AI gets it right and **knowing** it does.
