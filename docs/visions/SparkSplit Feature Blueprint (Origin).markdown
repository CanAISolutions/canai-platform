# SparkSplit: Trust Transparency Engine

## 1. Feature Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

SparkSplit is CanAI’s trust transparency feature, designed to build user confidence and prove customer investment value by presenting side-by-side comparisons of CanAI’s emotionally intelligent outputs and generic AI responses. It educates users on CanAI’s unique capabilities, drives advocacy, and establishes an unmatched competitive moat.

### 1.2 Objectives

- **Build Trust**: Demonstrate CanAI’s superiority through transparent evidence.
- **Enhance Transparency**: Show users how CanAI differs from generic AI.
- **Prove Value**: Justify customer investment with measurable emotional intelligence advantages.
- **Differentiate Competitively**: Position CanAI as the AI trust leader.
- **Drive Advocacy**: Create shareable moments that fuel organic growth.

## 2. User Problem & Value Proposition

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Users distrust AI due to opaque processes, impersonal outputs, and unverified quality claims. Customers investing in CanAI need clear, transparent proof that its emotionally intelligent responses deliver superior value compared to standard AI solutions.

### 2.2 Target Users

- **Enterprise Customers (Priority 1)**: Businesses seeking scalable AI with proven ROI. SparkSplit justifies investment, targeting 20%+ contract renewal rates.
- **End Users (Priority 2)**: Individuals using CanAI for personal or professional tasks, seeking trustworthy interactions. SparkSplit drives 25%+ advocacy.
- **Skeptical Prospects (Priority 3)**: Hesitant users needing proof of value. SparkSplit converts 15%+ into active users.

### 2.3 Value Proposition

SparkSplit empowers users by:

- Displaying CanAI’s emotionally intelligent output alongside a generic AI response.
- Quantifying emotional intelligence with a Trust Delta score (2.0+ point advantage).
- Asking, “Which output feels more like you?” to respect user choice.
- Educating users on emotional intelligence, fostering loyalty and referrals.

### 2.4 Competitive Landscape

SparkSplit creates a unique moat unmatchable by competitors like ChatGPT or Gemini, which lack emotional intelligence frameworks and transparent comparison mechanisms. Replicating SparkSplit requires rebuilding core architectures, estimated at 98% difficulty due to CanAI’s proprietary Trust Delta and Emotional Compass.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Functionality

SparkSplit will:

1. **Generate Dual Outputs**:
   - **CanAI Output**: Produce a personalized, emotionally intelligent response using CanAI’s core engine.
   - **Generic AI Output**: Simulate a standard, impersonal AI response using a lightweight model (e.g., based on open-source LLMs or rule-based templates).
2. **Calculate Trust Delta**:
   - Quantify emotional intelligence gap using a weighted scoring algorithm based on sentiment analysis across 5 axes (detailed in technical spec).
   - Target: 2.0+ point advantage, validated through user testing.
3. **Visualize Emotional Impact**:
   - Display a 5-axis Emotional Compass comparing outputs across:
     - **Awe**: Inspires wonder and excitement.
     - **Ownership**: Feels uniquely personal.
     - **Wonder**: Sparks possibility and creativity.
     - **Calm**: Instills peace and confidence.
     - **Power**: Amplifies user voice and agency.
4. **Present Comparison**:
   - Show outputs side-by-side with equal visual prominence.
   - Include Trust Delta and Emotional Compass in an intuitive UI.
5. **Prompt User Choice**:
   - Ask, “Which output feels more like you?” with a non-coercive prompt.

### 3.2 User Experience

- **Interaction Flow**:
  1. User submits a query to CanAI.
  2. SparkSplit displays both outputs, Trust Delta, and Emotional Compass.
  3. User selects preferred output or proceeds, with selections tracked for analytics.
- **Design Principles**:
  - **Transparency**: Present comparisons neutrally.
  - **Education**: Explain emotional intelligence simply.
  - **Sovereignty**: Respect user choice.
- **Circuit Breaker**:
  - Monitor engagement over 50 sessions.
  - Disable comparisons if negative patterns (e.g., disengagement) are detected, falling back to CanAI output.
  - Re-enable comparisons when engagement stabilizes.

### 3.3 User Interface

- **Comparison View**: Side-by-side layout with CanAI and generic outputs.
- **Emotional Compass**: Interactive radar chart showing 5-axis scores.
- **Trust Delta**: Numeric score (e.g., “+2.3”) with brief explanation.
- **Call-to-Action**: Button for “Which feels like you?”
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance (high-contrast visuals, screen reader support).
- **Mockup (Text-Based)**:
  ```
  +-----------------+-----------------+
  | CanAI Output    | Generic Output   |
  | [Text]          | [Text]          |
  +-----------------+-----------------+
  | Emotional Compass (Radar Chart)   |
  | Trust Delta: +2.3                |
  | [Button: "Which feels like you?"] |
  +-----------------------------------+
  ```
- **Note**: Low-fidelity wireframes to be provided in design spec.
