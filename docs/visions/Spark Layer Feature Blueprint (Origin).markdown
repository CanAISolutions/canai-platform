# Spark Layer: Feature Overview for PRD

## 1. Feature Overview

The **Spark Layer** is a critical component of CanAI’s emotional sovereignty platform, designed to generate three personalized, emotionally engaging concept names—called “sparks”—based on validated user intent from the Intent Mirror. Each spark (e.g., “The Connection Series” for an email campaign) is a concise, visionary title that transforms user goals into intriguing, identity-driven ideas, delivering immediate value and building trust. Positioned in the user journey after the Discovery Hook, Discovery Funnel, and Intent Mirror, the Spark Layer captivates users by showcasing CanAI’s ability to understand their vision, priming them for the Product Selection Recommendation stage.

### Purpose

- **For Users**: Deliver instant, tailored concept names that feel uniquely crafted, sparking excitement, curiosity, and trust in CanAI’s capabilities.
- **For CanAI**: Demonstrate emotional intelligence, differentiate from generic AI, and drive engagement toward product adoption.

### Value Proposition

- **Users**: Experience a moment of delight with creative, personally resonant sparks that validate their goals and inspire confidence.
- **Business**: Increases conversion rates and retention by creating emotional investment, reinforcing CanAI’s competitive edge, and facilitating product selection.

## 2. Core Functionality

### Overview

The Spark Layer automatically generates three distinct spark concept names after receiving validated intent from the Intent Mirror. Presented in a card-based interface, users select one spark, which informs the downstream Product Selection Recommendation stage. The Spark Layer leverages emotional resonance, curiosity-driven design, and trust transparency to maintain engagement and drive conversion.

### User Inputs

Receives structured data from the Intent Mirror:

- **Goal**: Primary objective (e.g., “Increase customer loyalty”).
- **Tone Preference**: Playful, Bold, Friendly, Professional, etc.
- **Industry Context**: Retail, Technology, Wellness, etc.
- **Challenge**: Specific obstacle (e.g., “Low customer retention”).
- **Emotional Context**: Inferred drivers (e.g., aspiration, urgency).
- **Behavioral Data**: Interaction patterns (e.g., input speed, field focus).

### User Flow

1. **Spark Generation**:
   - Automatically triggered post-Intent Mirror validation.
   - Generates three unique concept names (e.g., “The Loyalty Spark,” “The Connection Series,” “The Retention Engine”).
   - Each spark includes a title (10–15 characters) and an optional tagline (10–20 characters, e.g., “Build lasting relationships”).
2. **Spark Presentation**:
   - Displays sparks as three cards with titles, taglines, and visual cues (e.g., icons).
   - Offers a “See CanAI’s Edge” toggle for a trust-transparent comparison of one spark vs. a generic AI output.
3. **Spark Selection**:
   - Users select one spark with a single click.
   - Optional feedback prompt (e.g., “What drew you to this spark?”) collects brief insights.
4. **Transition**:
   - Selected spark, feedback, and input data are sent to the Product Selection Recommendation stage, with a confirmation message (“Great choice! Let’s shape your vision!”).

### Key Features

### Example User Journey

**User**: Sarah, a retail owner, wants to improve customer loyalty.

1. After Discovery Funnel and Intent Mirror, Sarah’s validated intent enters the Spark Layer: “Increase customer loyalty” (Goal), “Friendly” (Tone), “Retail” (Industry), “Low retention” (Challenge).
2. Three sparks are generated:
   - **Spark 1**: “The Loyalty Spark” – Tagline: “Reward repeat customers.”
   - **Spark 2**: “The Connection Series” – Tagline: “Warm relationships.”
   - **Spark 3**: “The Retention Engine” – Tagline: “Keep clients returning.”
3. Sarah views the cards, clicks “Compare CanAI’s Edge” to see “The Loyalty Spark” (personalized, friendly) vs. a generic AI’s “Customer Strategy” (vague), reinforcing trust.
4. She selects “The Connection Series,” answers “I love the relationship focus,” and sees “Great choice! Let’s shape your vision!” as her data advances.

### Design Principles

- **Engaging**: Visually appealing cards and intriguing names drive curiosity.
- **Intuitive**: One-click selection minimizes friction.
- **Trustworthy**: Transparency comparison builds confidence.
- **Inclusive**: Accessible, culturally sensitive design.

## 4. System Integrations
