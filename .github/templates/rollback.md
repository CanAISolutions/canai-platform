# CanAI Platform Rollback Procedure

## 🚨 **Emergency Rollback Protocol**

### **Rollback Decision Matrix**

| Severity     | Response Time | Rollback Required         |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Immediate     | Yes - Execute immediately |
| **High**     | < 15 minutes  | Yes - After assessment    |
| **Medium**   | < 1 hour      | Maybe - Evaluate options  |
| **Low**      | < 4 hours     | No - Fix forward          |

### **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Rollback**

- [ ] Payment processing completely broken
- [ ] Authentication system failure
- [ ] Data corruption or loss
- [ ] Security breach detected
- [ ] Site completely inaccessible
- [ ] Database connection failures

## 📋 **Pre-Rollback Checklist**

### **Incident Assessment**

- [ ] Issue severity confirmed
- [ ] Impact scope identified
- [ ] User impact assessed
- [ ] Business impact evaluated
- [ ] Rollback decision approved by stakeholder
- [ ] Incident team assembled

### **Communication Setup**

- [ ] Incident response channel created (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Customer support team alerted
- [ ] Status page updated (if applicable)
- [ ] User notification prepared

### **Technical Preparation**

- [ ] Previous stable version identified
- [ ] Rollback scripts validated
- [ ] Database backup verified
- [ ] Environment variables backed up
- [ ] CDN cache invalidation plan ready

## 🔄 **Rollback Execution Steps**

### **Step 1: Immediate Stabilization**

```bash
# 1. Stop current deployment
kubectl scale deployment canai-frontend --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment canai-backend --replicas=0

# 2. Verify services stopped
kubectl get pods -l app=canai
```

### **Step 2: Database Rollback (if required)**

```sql
-- Only if database changes were made
-- Execute rollback migration
npm run migrate:rollback

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM critical_tables;
```

### **Step 3: Application Rollback**

```bash
# Frontend rollback
cd frontend
git checkout [PREVIOUS_STABLE_TAG]
npm ci
npm run build
npm run deploy:production

# Backend rollback
cd ../backend
git checkout [PREVIOUS_STABLE_TAG]
npm ci
npm run build
npm run deploy:production
```

### **Step 4: Environment Configuration**

```bash
# Restore previous environment variables
cp .env.backup .env

# Update configuration files
cp config/production.backup.json config/production.json

# Restart services with previous config
npm run restart:production
```

### **Step 5: Verification**

- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Payment processing functional
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] Key user journeys tested
- [ ] Error rates normalized

## 🔍 **Post-Rollback Validation**

### **System Health Checks**

```bash
# Health check endpoints
curl -f https://api.canai.app/health
curl -f https://canai.app/health

# Database connectivity
npm run db:check

# External service connectivity
npm run services:check
```

### **User Journey Testing**

- [ ] User registration working
- [ ] Login/logout functional
- [ ] Discovery funnel accessible
- [ ] Purchase flow operational
- [ ] Deliverable generation working
- [ ] Feedback submission active

### **Performance Validation**

- [ ] Response times < 500ms
- [ ] Error rates < 1%
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Memory usage normal
- [ ] CPU usage stable

## 📊 **Monitoring & Alerting**

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**

```yaml
# Application metrics
- response_time_p95 < 500ms
- error_rate < 1%
- availability > 99.9%

# Business metrics
- user_registrations_per_hour > baseline
- payment_success_rate > 95%
- conversion_rate > baseline

# Infrastructure metrics
- cpu_usage < 70%
- memory_usage < 80%
- disk_usage < 85%
```

### **Alert Configuration**

- [ ] Error rate alerts active
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Business metric alerts
- [ ] Infrastructure alerts
- [ ] Security monitoring active
