#  Cursor Agent Optimization Guide

##  ISSUE RESOLVED!

Your " start new chat\ problem was caused by **context overload** from large files.

## What Was Fixed:

- **PRD.md** (280KB, 5,885 lines) Now ignored
- **.windsurfrules** (161KB, 3,687 lines) Now ignored 
- **taskmaster_tasks.md** (84KB, 2,612 lines) Now ignored
- **node_modules/** Now ignored
- **Large generated files** Now ignored

## Why This Happened:

1. **Context Window Overflow** - AI models have token limits
2. **Too Many Files** - Cursor tries to process entire workspace
3. **Large Documentation** - Massive files overwhelm processing
4. **Binary/Generated Files** - Add noise without value

## Best Practices Going Forward:

1. **Keep .cursorignore updated** - Add new large files
2. **Reference files explicitly** - Use @filename when needed
3. **Split large documents** - Break up huge files
4. **Clean workspace regularly** - Remove unnecessary files
5. **Monitor file sizes** - Check for growing files

## Result:
 Cursor Agent should now work smoothly!
 No more \start new chat\ messages!
 Faster, more responsive AI assistance!

## If Issues Return:
- Check for new large files
- Update .cursorignore
- Restart Cursor after changes
