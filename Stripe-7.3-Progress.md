# Stripe Task 7.3 Progress Tracker (Requirements-Driven Audit)

**Scope:** This checklist is strictly aligned with TaskMaster Task 7.3 ("Implement payment processing and webhook handling"), Stripe-Payment-Strategy.md, and PRD.md. It covers only the requirements for secure Stripe webhook handling, event processing, error handling, and logging as defined in those sources. Items outside this scope (refunds, subscriptions, Make.com scenario config, etc.) are referenced as dependencies but not duplicated here.

**Methodology:**
- Each requirement is listed as a row.
- **Status**: [x] if there is direct, project-specific proof (test/code/doc); [ ] if not proven.
- **Proof**: Reference to test, code, or doc, or 'MISSING'.
- **Dependencies**: If the requirement is handled in another task, note the dependency.

**Legend:**
- [x] = Direct, project-specific proof exists (test/code/doc)
- [ ] = No direct proof; action required or handled in another task

**Dependencies:**
- Make.com scenario implementation/validation: Task 56, 58
- Refunds, subscriptions, payment logging: Task 7.4, 7.5, 7.6
- Integration tests for Make.com: Task 92
- Health checks: Task 128
- Analytics: Task 6, 88, 90

---

**Next Steps:**
- Address all [ ] items for full PRD/TaskMaster compliance.
- Update documentation and add missing tests as needed.
- Coordinate with dependent tasks for Make.com, analytics, and health checks.

# Stripe 7.3 Progress

- [x] Stripe webhook handler Make.com retry logic now always uses global fetch if available, fixing test hangs and ensuring all unit tests pass. Documented in stripe-payment-strategy.md. All tests passing as of this commit.
